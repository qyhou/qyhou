## Hi there, I'm Qiyu Hou (侯启予).
- Here is my homepage: [qyhou.com](https://qyhou.com)
- I'm currently working on multiple tasks of Document AI, such as Document Layout Analysis, OCR, Table Structure Recognition, Document Understanding, etc.
- I'm learning Mathematics and Economics in my free time.
- A long time ago I was really into cubing. In 2016, I built a robot that could solve a Rubik's Cube in 1 second. In the same year, I was among the World's top 10 in the Rubik's Clock event, with the highest ranking of NR-2 and AsR-3.
- I come from Jingjiang, Jiangsu and now live in Nanjing.
