## Hi there, I’m Qiyu Hou (侯启予).
- Here’s my homepage: [qyhou.com](https://qyhou.com)
- I focus on ML, CV, Language Models (VLMs, LLMs, and MLLMs), and Document Intelligence (Document Layout Analysis, OCR, Table Structure Recognition, and Document Understanding).
- I’m working on document processing pipelines, and agentic systems (RAG, Deep Search, and Deep Research).
- A long time ago, I was really into cubing. In 2016, I built a robot that could solve a Rubik’s Cube in one second. That same year, I ranked among the world’s top 10 in the Rubik’s Clock event, with a highest ranking of NR-2 and AsR-3.
- I’m currently based in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.
