## Hi there, I’m Qiyu Hou (侯启予).
- Here’s my homepage: [qyhou.com](https://qyhou.com)
- I’m currently working on various Document AI tasks, including Document Layout Analysis, OCR, Table Structure Recognition, Document Understanding, etc.
- In my free time, I enjoy learning Mathematics and Economics.
- A long time ago, I was really into cubing. In 2016, I built a robot that could solve a Rubik’s Cube in one second. That same year, I ranked among the world’s top 10 in the Rubik’s Clock event, with a highest ranking of NR-2 and AsR-3.
- I’m from Jingjiang, Jiangsu, and now live in Nanjing.
